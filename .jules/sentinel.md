## 2026-02-01 - Security Controls Disconnected from Logic
**Vulnerability:** The application defined robust security controls in `SecureMLX.swift` (symlink checks, permission hardening) but failed to use them in the actual model loading logic (`MLXProvider.swift`), which relied on insecure defaults.
**Learning:** Having security helper classes is not enough; they must be explicitly integrated into the business logic. "Security Layers" documentation can drift from implementation reality.
**Prevention:** Use architectural enforcement (e.g., factory patterns that require security context) or linting rules to ensure security wrappers are used instead of raw APIs.

## 2026-04-10 - Insecure Directory Prefix Validation
**Vulnerability:** Path validation using raw `hasPrefix` (e.g., `path.hasPrefix(allowedPrefix)`) allowed directory traversal bypasses where an attacker could access `/allowed_dir_evil` when only `/allowed_dir` was permitted.
**Learning:** Simple string prefix checks are insufficient for path validation as they do not account for directory boundaries.
**Prevention:** Always validate directory containment by ensuring the path perfectly matches the allowed directory or starts with the allowed directory followed by a path separator (e.g., `path == prefix || path.hasPrefix(prefix + "/")`).

## 2026-04-16 - Incorrect Null Byte Escaping
**Vulnerability:** A literal backslash zero `"\\0"` was used in an array of blocked characters instead of the actual null byte character `"\0"`. This allowed null bytes to pass through the validation filter since it was looking for the literal string `\0` rather than the byte value 0.
**Learning:** In Swift, `"\0"` represents the actual null byte, while `"\\0"` represents two characters: a backslash and a zero.
**Prevention:** Always verify that escape sequences used in security validation actually represent the intended character/byte value rather than literal strings.

## 2026-04-20 - Unchecked Cryptographic API Results
**Vulnerability:** The application called `SecRandomCopyBytes` to generate an encryption key, but explicitly discarded its return value with `_ =`. If random generation failed, the key buffer would remain uninitialized (all zeros), resulting in a highly predictable encryption key that fails open.
**Learning:** System cryptographic APIs and security functions must never have their status results ignored. A failure in key generation should securely fail the entire operation rather than silently producing an insecure key.
**Prevention:** Always verify the returned `OSStatus` (e.g., `errSecSuccess`) from system security APIs and explicitly handle failures by throwing an appropriate error. Never discard cryptographic API results.
