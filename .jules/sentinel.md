## 2026-02-01 - Security Controls Disconnected from Logic
**Vulnerability:** The application defined robust security controls in `SecureMLX.swift` (symlink checks, permission hardening) but failed to use them in the actual model loading logic (`MLXProvider.swift`), which relied on insecure defaults.
**Learning:** Having security helper classes is not enough; they must be explicitly integrated into the business logic. "Security Layers" documentation can drift from implementation reality.
**Prevention:** Use architectural enforcement (e.g., factory patterns that require security context) or linting rules to ensure security wrappers are used instead of raw APIs.
